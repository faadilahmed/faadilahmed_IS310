IS309 PROJECT PROPOSAL FAADIL AHMED
-The topic I wanted to analyze is the best cities for young adults to live in the United Kingdom

-Throughout this whole process, I was going back and forth on project ideas, however one of my friends
is seriously interested in working and moving to the United Kingdom, so he was looking over cities, he could
possibly move to.

-This inspired me to take a deeper dive into the project and to see what type of information I could find. I also
enjoy this type of research because of its practical application. I have prior experience in classes where I have
looked through large data, and narrowed down the statistics to help me determine an answer using what I found to
help me support a thesis. Some examples would be creating relationship models from data, to see if there is a
correlation in numbers.

This article gave me a little background how even though London may seem like a very popular city to live in, it
does have its drawbacks. The article mentions how younger adults are moving out of the big cities and moving into
smaller towns, where they are able to enjoy their lives more.

This website provided me with a lot of statistics I will use to analyze the different factors when considering to
a city such as average rent, average salary, the average mental wellbeing, 4g coverage, and the nightlife. The
website also allows me to gather the data from the statistics they have documented. The research also provides a
total score for all of the towns and cities, to give us a better understanding of how all the factors stack up,
and affect one’s decision to move out there.

-The main answer I want to answer through conducting my entire Research is based on my findings, what cities are
the best locations for young adults to move to?
- I am able to solve this by looking at what regions have the highest proportion of young adults occupied there,
the average living scores, comparing the rent of the town to the salaries, and the overall mental health wellbeing.

-My main goal is to highlight what cities in the United Kingdom, are beneficial for young adults to live in, and
why living in bigger cities does not always live up to the hype created.


-One thing I also want to further research is the GDP and GVA of cities in the United Kingdom, because this
gives me a better background of what I need to know, and how I can better assess the standard of living in the cities.

-My plan is to create Jupyter Notebook using python, where I will go through the different data sets I have collected,
and perform data analysis methods such as cleaning up the data, filtering what I need and don’t need to better solve
my questions, and narrow down the cities that are the most attractive locations for young adults to move into.

-My work plan:
-research the question online
-find data sets to scrape and analyze
-import to Jupyter Notebook
-clean and Filter the data
-narrow in on trends and analyze the data
-create data visualizations of what I found
-find 3-5 conclusions based on data
-do an overall analysis of what I found
-use that information to answer my question
-make a summary of my data/conclusions found
